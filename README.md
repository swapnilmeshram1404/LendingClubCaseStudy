# LENDING CLUB CASE STUDY

## PROBLEM STATEMENT :

This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, 
and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through 
a fast online interface. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is 
the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money 
lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, 
borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers 
labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants,
then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such 
applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.In other words, the company wants to understand the 
driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators 
of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## General Information
The aim of this project was to analyze and gain insights into the loan portfolio 
of a financial institution. The dataset consisted of various loan-related attributes such as 
loan amount, loan status, borrower information, and other relevant factors. Through extensive 
data exploration and visualization, we examined the distribution of loan amounts, loan status, 
and borrower characteristics. Additionally, we conducted bivariate analyses to understand the 
relationships between different variables. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we identified 
trends, patterns, and risk factors associated with credit risk.Overall, this project highlights 
the value of data analysis in mitigating credit risk, enhancing loan portfolio quality, and ensuring 
the financial stability of the institution.
